# Step 1: Use the official Node.js image for the build
FROM node:18 AS builder

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the Next.js app
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Use a lightweight Node.js image for the production runtime
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the necessary files from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/package*.json ./
COPY --from=builder /app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/next.config.js ./

# Expose the port Next.js will run on
EXPOSE 3000
